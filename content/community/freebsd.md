## Why I use FreeBSD?
As every linux users do I was and still am a [_distrohopper_](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=distrohopper), going from one Operating System to another, trying different window managers, custom setups, kernels etc. Yet I find myself coming back to **FreeBSD**. It isn't an easy option nor a popular one but it fits the way I think about computing.
It is a perfect blend of control, minimalism and functionality.

## What do I use with FreeBSD?
1. [**BSPWM**](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm)       : I currently use **bspwm(Binary Space Partioning Window Manager)** with [**sxhkd**](https://github.com/baskerville/sxhkd). I find it perfect since it does what the user wants it to. If you want it to be fancy then it'll fancy, if you want it to be minimal it will be that. As the user u have 100% control over its functionality.
2. [**Alacritty**](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty)   : My Terminal Emulator of choice- lightweight, fast and reliable. I also use it as my File Manager.
3. [**Vim**](https://github.com/vim/vim)         : Vi Improved or as its called **Vim** one of the best if not the best Text Editor I've used. It is lightweight and fast. I use it to edit my System Files
4. [**Emacs-nox**](https://github.com/gemone/emacs-nox.d)   : I use Emacs-nox, [_Doom Emacs_](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs) to be specific as my go to Terminal IDE when I'm working on projects.
5. [**Rofi**](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi)        : My prefered App launcher purely for the ability to customize it, use dmenu scripts and looks clean.

## My Journey with FreeBSD
When I first started with **FreeBSD**, it felt intimidating. The lack of user base meant fewer guides, but the challenge was part of the appeal as well. It forced me to RTFM, track my steps, make mistakes and learn from them. Shortly but surely this entire process increased my confidence in handling systems and configuring them to my tastes.

## Why go through such a Hassle? Why not stick with Linux?
Linux is everywhere. It has great support and an enormous community. But I find it fragmented — each distro comes with its own perks and baggage. While that feature-rich environment with constant problem-solving can be exciting, it can also feel chaotic.
**FreeBSD** is concise and flexible, allowing me to mold the system to my liking. Instead of working around defaults that don’t fit my workflow, I build exactly what I need and nothing more.

## Why I recommend FreeBSD?
**FreeBSD** is not for everyone, but if you’re willing to go through the learning curve, the payoff is immense. You end up with a system that is not only tailored to you but also improves your problem solving skills and boosts your confidence. For me, it’s a mix of control, stability, and a community that values mastery over hype. But never forget what you use and wish to stay with is your choice. After all it's just a preference and each have their own.
